#k-nearest

This Python code implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm for data points using the KNearestNeighbors class. KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification, based on the similarity of data points. This code provides a clear implementation of KNN, including the ability to specify the number of nearest neighbors (k).

Key Features:

The code defines a KNearestNeighbors class for KNN classification, allowing you to choose the number of nearest neighbors to consider.
It uses the Euclidean distance metric to determine the similarity between data points.
The algorithm classifies a new data point by finding its k-nearest neighbors and selecting the majority class.
Visualization of the data points and the classification result is provided using matplotlib.
